During the past 10 years new competitors have established themselves with the knowledge of fualts in MyDesktop, with more; advanced start up technology during the development phase. Having better technical and infrastracture technology / design. New competitors like Agentbox, Box + Dice, REX, Zenu, VaultRE (ex MyDesktop Developers) seemed very attractive to the established MyDesktop users. The population was becoming more and more tech savy, while their patients grew thinner. The custmer service alone amongest the competitors far exceeded the arrogant and notoriously week long trobleshooting many *MyDeskteop* users experienced.[^9]

## **The Attraction**
At certain periods housing boom in Australia drew more media attention than technology advancment. In 2021 December quarter, the total value of residential dwellings in Austalia was $9,901.6 billion, from $9,388.9 billion in september of same year. It is more shocking to see 5 years ago December 2016 total value of dewllings in Australia was $6,441.2 billion.

- Automising leads, optimising AI and machine learning to perform progressive profiling. Matching of buyers with agents, by data such as investment interest/timeframe to upto date market and suitable agent
- Live notification of offers; once vendors and agents are in the system, machine learning is able to automatically track their progression within the cycle. This contact segmentation empowers agents and vendors with up-to-date information
- Contact scoring automation, using JSOn script in Swagger, CRM is able to assign a point system to users action, such as requesting for an apprasial/ loan investigation. the more action is trigged the system will identify the user as a hot seller, automising leads
- Portal pushing, through API integration, a listing just needs to be uploaded onto the system inorder to synchronise across all linked real estate portals  
- Single data entry, simply enter information about clients into CRM once, automised to enter relevant information accross integrated third party add ons through open API

The co-developers of *MyDesktop* and *VaultRE* were able to understand the evolving need of agents to stay on top of the expanding market. By seamlessly integrating advance workflow automation, functioality, the best in AI, open API-first, algorithms, data infrastructure, code base, online processes and other information technology.[^13] Proptech Group developed a more advanced CRM system *eagleSoftware*.

This allows subcribers to manage a range of vendors with one system. Increasing the market share will increase the add ons through deep API integration, leading to increase ARPA.

## **Recommendations**

PTG's largest profitable revenue stream is its CRM platform, however they have yet to cover all spectriums to an industry leading standard. In the financial year of 2020 PTG had an Annual recurring revenue of $12.4 million. Since PTG is a high revenue earning company they are able to invest a portion of gross profit in development or aqusition of proptech companies. To maintain the companies existing platform, it would be best practice to select potential proptech companies that have the following;
- have a signficant customer base, that ties in with PTG existing customers
- clear profitability path
- well established in their market, or hav epotential to be
- management is structured and effective
- can clearly outline a framework to integrate to PTG lacking areas

### **Marketing growth**
PTG has esatblished a steady 40% of the Australian New Zealand CRM Makret share beining 3,465 out of roughly 12,200 residential real estate agencies. Commercial agencies has well over 18,000 offices. PTG would benefit from a larger market by integrating similar services, such as 
- automating the dudeligence of selling commercial property
- audio recording of notes during showing
- import property date, or view saple properties in the same market
- update client or property date anywhere

In United Kingdom there is approximate 21,500 offices that could utilise PTG's existing CRM and PM software. PTG could like previously target marketing campign to large real estate franchise, thereby simultaneouly signing large numbers of agencies. 


As of 2021 there are 154,431 customers using the basic free property investment platform, out of this only 1,037 are paying cutomers. These are strong leads that have already trusted PTG enough to use its software. Inorder to capitalise on this survey could be preofromed of non paying customers in exchange for temporary access to or unlock one or two premium services. THis information can then be analysed to perfom target adds or innovate new services, inorder to gain more paying customers.

The above recommendations are inline with existing proven streams of revenue, being Average REvenue Per Agency (ARPA). In 2019 ARPA in ANZ was $197, by September 2021 ARPA increase dto $236. This was inline with the merger of Investar and VaultRE, integration egalysoftware and rello along with hundreads of add-ons by PTG or third party developers. This in all contributed to clients fredom when customizing the CRM for their agency.
