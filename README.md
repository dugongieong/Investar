Hi all I'm Andrew, I was born and raised in Sydney. I have a habit of changing careers ranging from student of Architecture, civil supervising, different laboring/trades. Currently I am a workshop carpenter. One thing that has stayed consistent is my hobby for drawing, so I am keen to learn the ins and outs of NFT.
