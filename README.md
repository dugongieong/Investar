## Landscape:

<span style="color: grey">* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Mortgage/Real Estate

<span style="color: grey">* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Since the first CRM system *MyDesktop* developed in 1997 during the Dot com boom, technology has exponital become more capable and widely used by the general public. During the past 10 years new competitors have established themselves with the knowledge of fualts in *MyDesktop*, more advanced start up technology that *MyDesktop* didn't have access to during the development phase. Having better technical and infrastracture design made competitors like Agentbox, Box + Dice, REX, Zenu, VaultRE (ex MyDesktop Developers) seem very attractive to the established *MyDesktop* users. The population was becoming more and more tech savy, while the patients grew thinner. The costmer service alone amongest the competitors far exceeded the arrogant and notoriously week long trobleshooting many *MyDeskteop* users experienced.
